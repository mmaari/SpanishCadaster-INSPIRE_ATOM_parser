# SpanishCadaster-INSPIRE_ATOM_parser
Python script for batch download of the Spanish Cadaster through the INSPIRE-ATOM service. 

NOTE1: This script performs a batch download of the buildings, but it can be easily adapted to download addresses and parcels. Just change the general link from which the batch download starts. 
NOTE2: Since June 2024, the R package [CatastRo](https://ropenspain.github.io/CatastRo/index.html) ([Delgado Panadero, Hernang√≥mez (2024)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11427138)) is available.
